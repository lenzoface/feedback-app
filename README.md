# Feedback App - My first React App!

This is my first try with React, coding along the course on Udemy by Brad Traversy. 
Great way to start the journey of learning React!

## Try it out!

You can try this app by clicking the next link:
https://feedback-app-skhan.netlify.app

(There is no actual backend, so it won't save edits on the page after reload)

## You can leave, edit and delete Feedbacks!

All using only react and a bit of a mock backend
